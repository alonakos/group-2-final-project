Early Skin Cancer Detection from 3D Body Images with Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing deep learning algorithms to identify confirmed skin cancer cases from 3D total body photographs (TBP). The dataset includes single-lesion crops from TBP images, with quality similar to smartphone close-ups commonly submitted for telehealth.

The goal is to create a binary classification model capable of distinguishing malignant from benign lesions. This model has potential applications in settings lacking specialized dermatologic care, helping to improve early detection and triage for skin cancer, which is crucial for better patient outcomes.

This project is part of the [ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge) with 3D-TBP hosted on Kaggle.
